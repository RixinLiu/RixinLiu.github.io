    Hey, I'm Rixin, but you can call me Ryan. 
    I'm a first-year CS PhD student at Rice University advised by Prof. <a href="https://jxing.me/" target="_blank">Jiarong Xing</a>.
    Prior to this, I got my B.E. in Computer Science and Technology from South China University of Technology in 2025.

    About my research,
    overall, I’m a <strong>system researcher</strong>.
    My earlier work focused on high-performance networking, particularly on RDMA, programmable switches, and DPUs. 
    Currently, my research centers on MLSys, aiming to address system and algorithmic challenges in a future dominated by specialized language models. 
    My recent work primarily involves <strong>GPUs</strong> and <strong>LLM routing</strong>.
